# LIRI-Bot


LIRI is a Node.js app that integrates OMDB, Spotify, and Bands In Town api to retrieve and post results.
Authentication keys will be stored in keys.js and we will export the keys to our main javascript file called liri.js.

The technologies used:
* Node.js
* Javascript
* APIs

User will input 1 of 3 commands to get a response:
1. Song: spotify-this-song
2. Movie: movie-this
3. Concert: concert-this

The program will then make a request to the APIs and the results will be logged in log.txt file.
